# Cloud-1 Project

## Project Description

This project is part of the **42** curriculum and involves deploying cloud infrastructure using **Terraform** and **Ansible**. The project includes the creation of virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, setting up networks, and deploying various services such as web servers and databases. **Ansible** is used for automating the configuration of the servers after they are created.

The project includes:
- Deploying virtual machines in the cloud (e.g., GCP).
- Configuring networking and host settings.
- Automating server provisioning with **Ansible**.
- Generating and adding architecture diagrams to the documentation.

## Tech Stack

- **Terraform** — for managing infrastructure as code.
- **Ansible** — for automating server setup and configuration.
- **GCP** — cloud platform for deploying servers.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** — for containerization (if applicable).
- **Shell scripting** — for auxiliary scripting tasks.
